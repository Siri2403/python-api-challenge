#Overview

This exercise looks at two activities: "WeatherPy" and VacationPy"

WeatherPy: This activities focuses on using api keys to pull information and storing them into a .csv file. Using this file and the information in it, we have plotted scatter plots and derived a linear relationship between the latitude of the location and other factors like temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed. We have done this in both the nothern and the southern hemisphere. All the scatter plots and the .csv file can be found in the file called "output".

VacationPy: This exercise uses the information in the city_details.csv file to further analyze and plot on a geo mapregarding the locations and hotels found in them, if any.
